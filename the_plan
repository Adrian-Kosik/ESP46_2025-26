This is the plan:

1. Write code
2. Run code
3. Party


The side plan:

1. Figure out how to PWM and direction the motors
2. Figure out how to collect the sensor data
3. Create a PID equation based on sensor data
4. Create a variable for PWM to get adjusted based on PID equation
5. Play with the variables to see if we can increase speed
6. Figure out the Bluetooth connection and interrupt
