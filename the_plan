This is the plan:

1. Write code
2. Run code
3. Party


The side plan:

1. Figure out how to PWM and direction the motors
2. Figure out how to collect the sensor data
3. Create a PID equation based on sensor data
4. Create a variable for PWM to get adjusted based on PID equation
5. Play with the variables to see if we can increase speed
6. Figure out the Bluetooth connection and interrupt

TD1
1. Successful use of PWM output (10) - Show run-time control of duty cycle on oscilloscope [Both of T1s L testpoint] - WORKING

2. Drive both motors (15) - Motors run at two different speeds for the motors.  - WORKING

3. Measure signal from the encoder (10) - Display to indicate that the microcontroller can detect edges of encoder signal - WORKING

4. Components and boards fitted with wiring (10) - wires need changing

5. Mechanical finishing (5) - Gears rotate smoothly. Check for rough/sharp edges at cuts and drilled surfaces - need to smooth out corners

6. Independent control of buggy wheels (30) - Buggy should trace a 0.5m square on the floor. Then turn around and re-trace square back. - need to figure out the exact length

7. Presentation (20) - everyone answer questions
